# DataVizQA

## Overview
DataVizQA is a user-friendly application that allows users to interact with tabular datasets by asking questions and receiving meaningful visualizations and interpretations in return. It is designed to handle a variety of datasets, ensuring robustness and relevance in its outputs.

The application is built using **Streamlit** for the interface and integrates **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** to generate Python code for visualizations. Users can upload data, clean it, and generate insightful plots with AI assistance. Additionally, users can upload plots and receive automatic insights and interpretations.

## Features
- **Home Page**: 
  - General information about the application.
  - Upload, clean, and view datasets.
- **Data Visualization Page**:
  - Upload and clean datasets.
  - Ask for specific visualizations in natural language.
  - Prompts are sent to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which returns Python code.
  - The generated code is cleaned, executed, and the plot is rendered in the Streamlit environment.
- **Get Insights Page**:
  - Upload a plot and receive automatic insights and interpretations using Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
